==== Recommendations ====

1. Optimal System Capacity:
   Based on the simulation results, a system capacity of 6 is recommended to maintain an average waiting time of less than 5 minutes while minimizing rejections.

2. Capacity Planning Strategies:
   - Consider implementing a dynamic capacity system that can adjust based on demand patterns.
   - Monitor the trade-off between waiting time and rejection probability regularly.
   - For periods of high call volume, consider temporary increases in system capacity.

3. Performance Optimization:
   - If the agent utilization is consistently high (>85%), consider adding another agent.
   - Implement a callback system for customers when the system is near capacity.
   - Consider specialized training for the agent to reduce service time without compromising quality.
   - Implement a pre-recorded information system to handle common queries before connecting to the agent.

4. Assumptions:
   - Poisson arrival process (exponential inter-arrival times)
   - Exponential service times
   - First-come, first-served queue discipline
   - Stationary arrival and service rates (no time-of-day variations)
   - No customer abandonment (reneging or balking)
   - Single service channel
