# Call Center Simulation (M/M/1/c Queue)

## Overview
This project simulates a call center using an **M/M/1/c** queuing model, where:
- **M/M/1** represents a **single-agent** call center with **exponentially distributed** inter-arrival and service times.
- **c** is the **system capacity**, including the customer being served.
- The simulation measures key performance metrics and analyzes the effect of varying system capacity.

## Problem Statement
A call center operates with **one agent** to handle incoming customer calls, with a **limited waiting capacity**.
- Calls **arrive following a Poisson process** (arrival rate \( \lambda = 20 \) calls/hour).
- A single agent serves calls, and **service time follows an exponential distribution** (service rate \( \mu = 24 \) calls/hour).
- The system has a finite **capacity (c = 5),** including the ongoing call.
- If the system is full, **new calls are rejected**.

The simulation evaluates the following **performance metrics**:
1. **Average waiting time** for customers in the queue.
2. **Average time spent in the system** (waiting + service time).
3. **Utilization rate** of the agent.
4. **Average number of customers in the queue**.
5. **Probability of system being full**.
6. **Probability of customer rejection**.

The system capacity is varied from **3 to 7**, and its impact on performance is analyzed.

## Files in This Project

### 1. `q2.cpp` (Call Center Simulation)
- Implements a **discrete event simulation (DES)** for an **M/M/1/c** queue.
- Uses a **priority queue** to process **arrival and departure events**.
- Records statistics such as waiting time, agent utilization, and rejection probability.
- Outputs simulation results to `call_center_simulation_results.txt`.
- Supports varying system capacity to analyze performance impact.

### 2. `plot-call-center-metrics.py` (Performance Visualization)
- Reads output files generated by `q2.cpp`.
- Plots:
  - **Average Waiting Time vs. System Capacity**.
  - **Agent Utilization vs. System Capacity**.
  - **Rejection Probability vs. System Capacity**.
- Saves plots as `call_center_metrics.png` and `call_center_combined_metrics.png`.

### 3. `Makefile` (Build & Run Automation)
This Makefile automates:
- **Compilation** of `q2.cpp`.
- **Execution** of the compiled simulation.
- **Plot generation** using Python.

#### Usage:
```bash
make        # Compile and run the simulation, then plot results
make clean  # Remove compiled files
```

## How to Run the Simulation

### **Step 1: Compile & Run the Simulation**
```bash
make
```
This compiles `q2.cpp` and runs the simulation, generating output files for different capacities.

### **Step 2: Plot the Results**
The Python script automatically runs after the simulation and generates performance plots.

### **Step 3: View the Results**
- **Simulation Report:** `call_center_simulation_results.txt`
- **Performance Plots:**
  - `call_center_metrics.png`
  - `call_center_combined_metrics.png`

## Analysis & Optimization
### **Findings from Simulation**
- Increasing **system capacity** reduces **waiting time** and **rejection probability**.
- **Agent utilization** decreases as **capacity increases**.
- The **optimal capacity** is the smallest value that keeps **waiting time under 5 minutes** while minimizing **rejections**.

### **Optimization Strategies**
- Implement **dynamic capacity adjustment** based on demand.
- Consider adding a **second agent** if utilization exceeds **85%**.
- Use a **callback system** to reduce customer dropouts.
- Train agents to **reduce service time** for better efficiency.

---

## Assumptions
- **Poisson process** for call arrivals.
- **Exponential service times**.
- **First-come, first-served** queue.
- **Fixed service rate** (no agent fatigue or variability).
- **No customer abandonment** (reneging or balking).
- **Single service agent** (no parallel processing).

---

## Conclusion
This simulation models and analyzes a **single-agent call center with limited waiting capacity**. The results highlight key trade-offs between **waiting time, agent utilization, and rejection probability**. The insights help optimize **capacity planning and service efficiency** for real-world call centers.
