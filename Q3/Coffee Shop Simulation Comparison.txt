 Revenue Impact Analysis (With Reneging)

| Configuration Change          | Revenue Impact           |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Faster Service (μ = 20)       | +$210.00                 |
| Slower Service (μ = 12)       | -$320.00                 |
| Adding Second Barista         | +$390.00                 |

Key Insights

1. **Customer Reneging Effect**: When customers abandon queues after waiting 5 minutes, wait times decrease dramatically but at the cost of lost revenue.

2. **Service Speed Impact**: Increasing service speed from μ=15 to μ=20 reduces abandonment by 8.4 percentage points, saving $210 in revenue.

3. **Two-Server Configuration**: Adding a second barista provides the best customer experience (lowest wait time) and highest revenue retention (only 2% abandonment), though at higher labor cost.

4. **Congestion Warning**: Slower service (μ=12) creates severe congestion without reneging (34.5-minute wait), and loses 30.4% of customers with reneging.

5. **Utilization Tradeoff**: Reneging significantly reduces server utilization across all configurations, which improves customer experience but may indicate inefficient resource use.
